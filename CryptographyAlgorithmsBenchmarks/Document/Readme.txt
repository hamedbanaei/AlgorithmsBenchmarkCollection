Interpreting the Benchmarking Results
Here's what each of the legends represent:

Method: This column specifies the name of the method that has been benchmarked.
Mean: This column specifies the average time or the arithmetic mean of the measurements made on execution of the method being benchmarked.
StdDev: This column specifies the standard deviation, i.e., the extent to which the execution time deviated from the mean time.
Gen 0: This column specifies the Gen 0 collections made for each set of 1000 operations.
Gen 1: This column specifies the Gen 1 collections made for each set of 1000 operations.
Gen 2: This column specifies the Gen 2 collections made for each set of 1000 operations. (Note that here, Gen 2 isn't shown because there were no Gen 2 collections in this example.)
Allocated: This column specifies the managed memory allocated for a single operation.
